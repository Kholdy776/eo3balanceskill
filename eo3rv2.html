Download the latest version only and apply to a vanilla English ROM (filename: 5233 Etrian Odyssey III - The Drowned City (US).nds - however any good dump should work)<br><br>

<!--If you are updating from an older version, do not apply the patch to your patch version. Patch your vanilla ROM, and save your new patched file over your old patched file.<br><br>-->
