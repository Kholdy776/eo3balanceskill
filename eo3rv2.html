<b>This is an early demo release for EO3Rv2. It is very much incomplete and contains bugs. It is intended only for testing purposes.</b><br><br>

Download the latest version only and apply to a vanilla ROM (filename: 5233 Etrian Odyssey III - The Drowned City (US).nds - however any good dump should work)<br><br>

<!--If you are updating from an older version, do not apply the patch to your patch version. Patch your vanilla ROM, and save your new patched file over your old patched file.<br><br>-->

To apply, download <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/">xdelta UI</a>.<br><br>

<b>Note for Twilight Menu users:</b> Twilight Menu does not properly bypass the anti-piracy features and will freeze during battles. TWLoader is known to work.<br><br>
